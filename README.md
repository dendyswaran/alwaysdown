2. Select an application from the left panel
3. View real-time logs in the right panel
4. Use the filter box to search log content
5. Enable **"Auto Scroll"** for continuous monitoring

### Configuration Files

The application stores configurations in:
```
%LocalAppData%\AlwaysDown\Config\
â”œâ”€â”€ applications.json          # Main applications list
â”œâ”€â”€ settings.json             # Application settings
â””â”€â”€ [app-id].json            # Individual app configs for services
```

Logs are stored in:
```
%LocalAppData%\AlwaysDown\Logs\
â””â”€â”€ [service-name].log       # Individual application logs (named after service)
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **NodeJsProcessManager**: Manages Node.js processes, handles start/stop/restart operations (turns out it also supports python and java)
- **WindowsServiceManager**: Handles Windows service installation and management
- **ConfigurationManager**: Manages application configuration and settings persistence
- **NodeJsApplication**: Data model representing a Node.js application

### Service Architecture

When an application is installed as a Windows service:

1. A service host executable (`NodeJsServiceHost.exe`) is created
2. The Windows service is registered with the system
3. Service configuration is stored in JSON format
4. The service automatically restarts failed applications
5. Logs are written to Windows Event Log and local files

## Development

### Building from Source

1. **Clone** the repository
2. **Open** the solution in Visual Studio 2022 or later
3. **Restore** NuGet packages
4. **Build** the solution (Debug or Release configuration)

### Dependencies

- **Newtonsoft.Json**: JSON serialization and deserialization
- **System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController**: Windows service management
- **Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.WindowsServices**: Windows service hosting

## Building Release

The project includes automated build scripts for creating different types of release packages. All scripts are located in the root directory and should be run from a command prompt with administrator privileges.

### Prerequisites

- **.NET 8.0 SDK**: Required for building the application
- **Windows 10/11**: Build environment
- **Administrator privileges**: Required for some build operations
- **NSIS (Optional)**: For creating installers - download from [https://nsis.sourceforge.io/](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/)

### Release Build Process

#### 1. Basic Release Build

Run the main build script to create both standalone and framework-dependent versions:

```batch
build-release.bat
```

This script performs the following steps:
1. **Cleans** previous builds (removes existing `Release` folder)
2. **Restores** NuGet dependencies
3. **Builds** the Release configuration
4. **Publishes** self-contained executable (~100MB, includes .NET runtime)
5. **Publishes** framework-dependent version (~1MB, requires .NET 8.0 Runtime)
6. **Copies** documentation files (README.md, USAGE_EXAMPLE.md, LICENSE)
7. **Renames** executables to `AlwaysDown.exe`

**Output Structure:**
```
Release/
â”œâ”€â”€ AlwaysDown-Standalone/           # Self-contained version
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AlwaysDown.exe              # Main executable
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ *.dll                       # Runtime libraries
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ WinForm.pdb                 # Debug symbols
â”œâ”€â”€ AlwaysDown-FrameworkDependent/  # Framework-dependent version
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AlwaysDown.exe              # Main executable
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ *.dll                       # Application libraries
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ WinForm.pdb                 # Debug symbols
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                       # Documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ USAGE_EXAMPLE.md               # Quick start guide
â””â”€â”€ LICENSE                        # License file
```

#### 2. Creating Portable Packages

Create ZIP packages for easy distribution:

```batch
create-portable.bat
```

This script:
- **Automatically runs** `build-release.bat` if needed
- **Creates** ZIP packages using PowerShell compression
- **Generates** portable README with setup instructions

**Output Files:**
- `AlwaysDown-v1.1.0-Portable-Standalone.zip` (~100MB)
- `AlwaysDown-v1.1.0-Portable-FrameworkDependent.zip` (~1MB)
- `PORTABLE-README.txt` (Setup instructions)

#### 3. Creating Windows Installer

Create a professional Windows installer (requires NSIS):

```batch
create-installer.bat
```

This script:
- **Checks** for NSIS installation
- **Automatically runs** `build-release.bat` if needed
- **Generates** NSIS installer script
- **Compiles** installer executable

**Output:**
- `AlwaysDown-Setup-v1.1.0.exe` (Windows installer)

**Installer Features:**
- Professional installation wizard
- Desktop and Start Menu shortcuts
- Add/Remove Programs integration
- Clean uninstallation support

### Release Types Comparison

| Type | Size | Dependencies | Use Case |
|------|------|--------------|----------|
| **Standalone** | ~100MB | None | End users, no .NET installed |
| **Framework-Dependent** | ~1MB | .NET 8.0 Runtime | Developers, .NET already installed |
| **Installer** | ~100MB | None | Professional deployment |

### Manual Build Commands

For advanced users, you can build manually using .NET CLI:

```batch
# Clean and restore
dotnet clean WinForm\WinForm.csproj
dotnet restore WinForm\WinForm.csproj

# Build Release configuration
dotnet build WinForm\WinForm.csproj -c Release

# Publish self-contained
dotnet publish WinForm\WinForm.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:PublishReadyToRun=true -o Output\Standalone

# Publish framework-dependent
dotnet publish WinForm\WinForm.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained false -o Output\FrameworkDependent
```

### Build Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

- **"dotnet command not found"**: Install .NET 8.0 SDK
- **"Access denied"**: Run command prompt as Administrator
- **"NSIS not found"**: Install NSIS and add to PATH, or use portable packages instead
- **"Build failed"**: Check that all NuGet packages are restored correctly

**Build Environment:**
- Ensure Windows Defender or antivirus isn't blocking the build process
- Check that the `WinForm` folder structure is intact
- Verify all project files (.csproj, .cs) are present

### Project Structure

```
WinForm/
â”œâ”€â”€ Models/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ NodeJsApplication.cs     # Application data model
â”œâ”€â”€ Services/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ NodeJsProcessManager.cs  # Process management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ WindowsServiceManager.cs # Service management
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ConfigurationManager.cs  # Configuration handling
â”œâ”€â”€ Form1.cs                     # Main form logic
â”œâ”€â”€ Form1.Designer.cs            # UI design
â”œâ”€â”€ Program.cs                   # Application entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ WinForm.csproj              # Project configuration
â””â”€â”€ app.manifest                # Administrator privileges manifest
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Application won't start as Administrator**
- Ensure the application manifest requests administrator privileges
- Right-click the executable and select "Run as administrator"

**Node.js application won't start**
- Verify Node.js is installed and accessible from PATH
- Check that the project path contains a valid Node.js application
- Ensure the start command is correct (e.g., `npm run start`)

**Windows service installation fails**
- Ensure running as Administrator
- Check Windows Event Log for detailed error messages
- Verify the service name doesn't conflict with existing services

**Logs not appearing**
- Check that the application is actually running
- Verify log file permissions in `%LocalAppData%\NodeJsManager\Logs\`
- Ensure the Node.js application outputs to stdout/stderr

### Log Locations

- **Application Logs**: `%LocalAppData%\AlwaysDown\Logs\`
- **Windows Event Log**: Look for events from services starting with "AlwaysDownApp_"
- **Configuration**: `%LocalAppData%\AlwaysDown\Config\`

## Security Considerations

- The application requires Administrator privileges for Windows service management
- Service executables are created in the application directory
- Configuration files may contain sensitive information (paths, commands)
- Network ports specified in applications should be properly secured
